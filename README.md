This is the source code repository of the Webinterface for Jet Single Page web Application (SPA).

## Software Tools

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): A module bundler to easily combine and integrate any used JS module in a single JS-Bundle.
- [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader): TypeScript loader for webpack.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): React is our user interface library of choice, to split the complexity of the UI into easy digestable parts.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is a superset of Javascript and provides type safety to a level the user defines. Finally it compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter, which ensures that all the code is formatted the same way (no room for individual hickhack); tests will fail if code is not formatted as prettier does expect it to be
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- [Html Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin): Plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your bundles
